## Quick Start for Phase 2

When ready to start Phase 2:

```powershell
# 1. Set up Supabase
# - Go to supabase.com
# - Create new project
# - Copy credentials to .env.local

# 2. Run database migrations
# - Open Supabase SQL Editor
# - Paste schema from IMPLEMENTATION.md
# - Execute

# 3. Create service files
# - Create scripts/services/ directory
# - Implement supabaseClient.js first
# - Test connection

# 4. Implement incrementally
# - Start with room creation
# - Then joining
# - Then turn management
# - Then real-time sync

# 5. Test frequently
npm test
npm run dev
```
